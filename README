warp-sabre is a suite of programs to generate calibrated slippy map tiles
from a variety of old maps, and the main program to generate the in-house
mapping at SABRE Maps (https://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps).

It is derived off a suite of OpenStreetMap tools called warp-gbos (that
was used to produce the New Popular and Seventh Series tiles there,
that pre-date SABRE Maps) with some extra bells and whistles to handle
archaic things such as the MOT maps.

==Features==

The suite currently supports the following:

    Ordnance Survey GB National Grid
    WGS84 Lat/Lon
    Cassini (as used on England and Wales MoT maps)
    Scottish Bonne (as used on Scottish MoT maps)

It does not currently support (but will in the future):

    Ordnance Survey GB National Yard Grid (but conversion can be done manually)
    Irish Grid as used on OSI and OSNI mapping
    OSGB36 Lat/Lon

==Programs==

warp-sabre - combines a map image and calibration file to create a rectified
map image and a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file that can be loaded into
Google Maps or Google Earth to check the accuracy of the calibration file

gentiles - takes a group of rectified map images, with KML files, and creates
all the tiles (may take hours, sometimes days, to run)

cleartiles - takes a group of rectified map images, with KML files, and
deletes all the associated tiles. This is important when doing small,
incremental updates to a set of tiles with multiple maps; running cleartiles
before gentiles makes sure that all tiles that need to be updated
(particularly those that span the edge of maps) are re-created, but others
are left alone.

==Calibration file format==

Calibration files are a series of comma separated values. Each co-ordinate is
on one line. They look slightly different depending on whether you are using
lat / lon or grid references.

===Latitude / longitude===

A lat / lon file looks something like this:
p,51.8,-0.5,300,200
p,51.8,-0.1,1200,200
p,51.7,-0.5,300,900
p,51.7,-0.1,1200,200

The "p" tells the calibrator this is a lat / lon co-ordinate. The next
values are the latitude and longitude of the point, followed by the x and y
co-ordinate the point is on the map image.

===Grid reference===

A grid reference file looks something like this:
os,400000:250000,300,200
os,500000:250000,1200,200
os,400000:150000,300,900
os,500000:150000,1200,200

The "os" tells the calibrator this is a grid reference co-ordinate. The next
values are the metres east and metres north of the grid reference, followed by
the x and y co-ordinate the point is on the map image. (Note, the grid
reference values are separated by a colon, not a comma; this is because grid
references can also be specified using the two letters + number format, which
is not generally used by SABRE Maps).

In both of the examples, the calibration defines the four corners of a
map - top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right. The four corner
co-ordinates are the most important ones to include in a calibration file,
otherwise the map has no idea where it is supposed to be displayed in the
world - at all.

The following libraries are required:
* Boost - for odds and ends (mainly used for parsing command line arguments)
* ImageMagick 7 - for loading and saving images
* LibXML - for parsing Google Earth KML files
* Newmat - for the matrix transformations used when rectifying map images
* Xmorph - does the job of physically moving pixels in an image when
           rectifying it

Newmat and Xmorph lib are now included as part of the build process. The other libraries
are bundled as standard in most distributions

==Linux==
For Debian Linux, you should be able to run :
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libxml-dev

ImageMagick 7 is not bundled with Debian, so must be built from source.
See https://imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php

To build, run build_linux.sh

==macOS==
For macOS using homebrew:
brew install cmake imagemagick boost libxml2

To build, run build_homebrew.sh

make
sudo make install

==Windows==
For Windows using mingw64
pacman -S cmake mingw-w64-[platform]-x86_64-imagemagick mingw-w64-[platform]-x86_64-boost xml2

To build, run build_mingw.sh
